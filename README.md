You may hear this document referred to in short as the "User Guide" or the "White Paper" as you interact with your IMS engineer or project manager.  

**_Please invest the time to fully read and understand this document, which serves as the definitive guide for this type of project._**  The majority of media failures, project delays, factory exceptions and customer escapes we encounter can be traced to deviation from the user guide.

If you have any questions as you work toward implementation please reach out to your assigned IMS engineer who will be happy to assist.
